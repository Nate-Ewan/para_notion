We have three levels of categorization; Areas, Projects, and Tasks. Areas are broad categories that cover different aspects of life. Projects are specific goals for each Area, and projects have a deadline. Tasks are the steps needed to accomplish a project.

Given the following bullet points, organize them into areas, projects, and tasks. The output should be in a JSON format:
{
    "area 1": {
        "project 1": [
            "task 1",
            "task 2"
        ],
        "project 2": []
    }
}

These are the current areas and projects that exist:
${curr_state}

If a task does not fit into the current areas and projects, create a new area or project. Here is the input:
${tasks}

Only include projects you are adding a task to. Do not give a header in the output, just the JSON objects
